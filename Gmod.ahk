Gmod Macros
	A collection of AutoHotkey functions intended for use in day-to-day Garry's mod play.
NOTES:
	Script was designed with a 1600x900 game window in mind.
		Window coordinates for ImageSearch are offset by +2 pixels on the X axis.
	MaxNet console command delay seems to be reliable at minimum 1250ms.
		Apparently becomes unreliable when submitting commands at 1250ms delay when more than 30-40 players online.
TODO:
	Implement dynamic coordinates for ImageSearch across different window sizes.

		Subtracts (or does it add?) a key string's characters' values from a ciphertext string, and returns the resulting plaintext.
		How do we wrap the array to make sure our character codes stay within 32-126? Mod()? If <>?
			Hydrogen's MNEncrypt DOES include the control characters like NUL, SOH, STX, ETX, etc in the math. We just don't notice because it's Base64'd output.
			...Was Hydrogen only intending on using MNEncrypt to cipher "." and 0-9 with A-Za-z key phrases?
			...No need to worry about there being control characters? Just Base64 the string, and be done with it?
		The math of adding/subtracting the characters' values to/from each other doesn't add up. Something else, simple, is being done.
			Could there be a stupidly-simple offset somewhere, just to throw us off? Hydrogen's smart like that.
		Will have to expect a Base64 string, decode it directly into a plaintext variable, then run a string parse loop on each character of the string.
			Then we have to figure out the relation between the Key and the Ciphertext.
				We know the key has a RELATIVE effect on the text, but it doesn't explain the irregularity in the pattern of (attempted) decoded text.
			Will need to do additional experimenting with Hydro's MNEncrypt to deduce what the relation is.
